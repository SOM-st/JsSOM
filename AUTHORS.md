This file lists all people who have have a major contribution to JsSOM or a
related SOM implementation.

SOM was originally implemented in Java at the University of Aarhus (Denmark) in
2001/2002. The implementation of SOM was done by Jakob Roland Andersen, Kasper
Verdich Lund, Lars Bak, Mads Torgersen, and Ulrik Pagh Schultz. They also wrote
the original versions of the SOM Smalltalk libraries, test suites, and
benchmarks, that are (in changed and extended versions) bundled with JsSOM.

JsSOM is a port and simplification of TruffleSOM and RTruffleSOM to JavaScript,
which were all written by Stefan Marr.
