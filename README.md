JsSOM - The SOM (Simple Object Machine) Smalltalk implemented in JavaScript
===========================================================================

Introduction
------------

[SOM][SOM-st] is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction. It
was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus (Denmark) where it was used for
teaching and as the foundation for [Resilient Smalltalk][RS]. Later is was also
used for instance at the [Hasso Plattner Institute (Potsdam, Germany)][SOM].

In addition to JsSOM, [other implementations][github] exist for Java (SOM,
TruffleSOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), Python (PySOM), RPython (RPySOM,
RTruffleSOM) and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains a JavaScript-based implementation of SOM, including
SOM's standard library and a number of examples. JsSOM is a simple abstract
syntax tree interpreter. It isn't optimized or tuned for performance. However,
some aspects were easier to implement by doing node-replacement in a
self-optimizing interpreter style.

JsSOM's tests can be executed with:

    $ make  # note, it will download the Google Closure compiler
    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello/Hello.som

integer operations.
